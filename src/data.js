        text:"During the advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries, nature became the passive reality, organized and moved by divine laws.[3][4] With the Industrial revolution, nature increasingly became seen as the part of reality deprived from intentional intervention: it was hence considered as sacred by some traditions (Rousseau, American transcendentalism) or a mere decorum for divine providence or human history (Hegel, Marx).

        text:"Within the various uses of the word today, nature often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with inanimate objectsâ€”the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the weather and geology of the Earth.

        text:"The atmospheric conditions have been significantly altered from the original conditions by the presence of life-forms,[9] which create an ecological balance that stabilizes the surface conditions. Despite the wide regional variations in climate by latitude and other geographic factors, the long-term average global climate is quite stable during interglacial periods,[10] and variations of a degree"

        text:"Earth is estimated to have formed 4.54 billion years ago from the solar nebula, along with the Sun and other planets.[13] The Moon formed roughly 20 million years later. Initially molten, the outer layer of the Earth cooled, resulting in the solid crust. Outgassing and volcanic activity produced the primordial atmosphere. Condensing water vapor, most or all of which came from ice delivered by comets, produced the oceans and other water sources.[14] The highly energetic chemistry is believed to have produced a self-replicating molecule around 4 billion years ago."
